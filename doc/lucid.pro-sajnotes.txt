=== ABOUT SAJITHA  / BIO ====
Sajitha Jahangir Sivers was born in a little village in Tami Nadu, India, speaking the local language (Tamil) until her family moved to New York City when she was a child.  As a young student, her process of learning English was so empowering that she committed herself to a deep study of both English and education.

Sajitha majored in English at the State University of New York at Stonybrook in 2000 and completed her student teaching in Long Island, New York. She then spent the next several years teaching middle school and high school English in New York and New Jersey. Her classroom showcased a vast spectrum of students, with different abilities, talents, interests, and learning styles. Striving to understand how her students learned best prompted Sajitha to investigate theories and practices in learning, leading her to earn her master's degree in Educational Psychology from New York University in 2005.

Sajitha’s experiences in classroom teaching and in higher education inspired her to help other teachers reach all learners. The best avenue to accomplish this goal seemed to be through educational publishing, writing lessons that empowered both teachers and students. Sajitha started at Kaplan K12 Learning Services as a writer, and after five years of experience in curriculum development, she was promoted to Director of Literacy at Kaplan, and won a company-wide award for excellence in 2009.

In 2010, she renewed her commitment to teachers and students by founding Lucid Learning LLC, an educational writing company, as the culmination of ten years of experience both in the classroom and publishing worlds.



=== WRITING SAMPLES ==== 
Improving Paragraphs: Teacher’s Edition
* - This lesson comes from a program called Focus on Writing, designed to teach students how to answer essay questions that appear on standardized tests. Each lesson breaks down critical skills and guides students through the steps of writing: prewriting, drafting, revising, and editing.
New Neighbors
* - This is an excerpt from the student edition of Focus on Reading, a comprehensive reading strategy program with fiction and nonfiction passages and standardized test-like questions. One key feature of this program is the leveled text it uses: the same stories and articles are written at several different reading levels so that students of different abilities can all read the same material.
