New Neighbors

<p>
This is an excerpt from the student edition of Focus on Reading, a comprehensive reading strategy program with fiction and nonfiction passages and standardized test-like questions. One key feature of this program is the leveled text it uses: the same stories and articles are written at several different reading levels so that students of different abilities can all read the same material.
